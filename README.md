# negative-joy

I made this app in 10 days with intention of practice and to get a little insight into Android development.

Floating and draggable bottlecap with the famous meme Yoba and if you tap it, it flips and you got a funny message from him. 
For the emotion detection I used Azure Cognitive Services.
It can detect:
 - anger
 - disgust
 - fear
 - happiness
 - neutral
 - sadness
 - surprise
 
 It can also send a notification about the current BTC price.

If you would like to use it you have to provide your own api keys.
